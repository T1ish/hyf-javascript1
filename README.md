This folder contains Week1 Javascript Homework for HYF
In the folder week1 you will find many files but the exercise commands are to be found in Step1CommandLineSolution.txt and Step2JSSolution.js files. 

In the first file I've just written the commands for making the txt files meaning the solution while in the second file I've written the exercises and their solutions.
